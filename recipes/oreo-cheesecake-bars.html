        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with heavy-duty foil, allowing 2 inches of overhang on two opposite sides of the pan. Coat foil lightly with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place 30 cookies in a food processor. Cover and pulse until finely ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add melted butter and pulse just until combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Transfer mixture to the prepared pan. Press crumbs evenly into the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Add sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Beat until just combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Coarsely crush the remaining oreo(s) by placing them in a resealable bag and hitting it with a rolling pin.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Reserve 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs. Fold the remaining crumbs into the batter.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 11:</strong> Pour batter evenly over pre-baked crust, smoothing the top as necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 12:</strong> Sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 13:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until the center appears set, with a slight jiggle, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 14:</strong> Cool in a pan on a wire rack for 2 hours, or until completely cool. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 15:</strong> Remove uncut bars from the pan by lifting foil.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 16:</strong> Cut into 2x2-inch bars to serve.</li>
